## Guide for the application
Application has two previously registered user accounts for test:

* Email: jovan.gppapi@hotmail.com; 
  UserName: JuniorPapi
  Password: dd; 
  Role: Admin


* Email: jovan.papi@hotmail.com;
  UserName: Papi;
  Password: aa; 
  Role: User

You can log in either with the email or the username.

If you want to use all features of the application
(the ones that are currently implemented) like view suggested products;
create/delete/edit product etc. then log in with the first account.
Otherwise, login with the second account (try both for testing).

If you dont login, then you can only use the basic features
of the application like home page, menu to search products only, 
voice assistant and about us page.

Either way, the use of the actions are restricted by the roles of the 
user or if user is not logged in. Message will be shown only if you are 
not logged in and you use actions like profile and reservation.

There are validation that can be tried to test the input data for:
login; register; edit; change-password; edit product; reservation etc.

For everything else, use the application and discover its features.

## Voice assistant

* First click the button, and while the red dot blinks in the browser site tab, then say:

Hello

Open profile page

Redirect to register page

...

* You can also construct complex phrase like:

Please open menu salad/grill... for me.

Can you redirect me to home page ?

How about you open about us page ?

...

## When opening menu action, please click twice to open the drop down list
